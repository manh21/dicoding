                <h5>Character</h5>
                <p><strong>How to Obtain :</strong> Characters can primarily be obtained by using Primogems to perform Wishes (gacha pulls). The starter characters: Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa, can be obtained early on in the main storyline (Archon Quests). Some characters may also be purchased from the monthly Paimon's Bargains shop in exchange for Masterless Starglitter. </p>
                <p><strong>Leveling :</strong> Characters can gain experience primarily by completing quests and using Character EXP Materials. Characters will also get a very small amount of experience for defeating monsters. </p>
                <p><strong>Ascensions :</strong> Characters can be ascended to their next Phase once they reach their current max level up to 6 times (Lv.90). Upon reaching the 1st and 3rd Phase/ascension, the character unlocks a new passive talent. The 3rd passive talent, if the character has one, is already unlocked at Phase 0. </p>
